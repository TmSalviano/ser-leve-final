## Analise de Similares
Tradicional regular webpages that posts recipes to it and people read it, learn it and that is it. No human connection, very limited ability to personalize and make the webpages yours. This offers very little incentive for the user to do anything more thant just grab the recipe and never return, which is not a good environment for making money. Usually flooded with adds for the same reason cited previously.
